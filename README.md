GetCleanData_CourseProject
==========================

The course project assignment for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The code found in the file run_analysis.R is intended to be run by running all lines of included code in sequence. The code is commented to explain what each step does. The code assumes that a file called "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" is saved in the current working directory. "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A description of the original data is found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
